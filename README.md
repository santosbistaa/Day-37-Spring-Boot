Day 37: Leveling Up My AOP Skills with Pointcut Declarations!

Today I dove deeper into Spring AOP and learned how to:
1) Declare reusable pointcuts
 -Created clean, modular expressions with @Pointcut
 -Organized cross-cutting concerns like a pro
2) Applied them in code
 -Eliminated duplicate expressions
 -Made my aspects more maintainable

Day 38: Supercharging AOP with Combined Pointcuts!
Today I unlocked next-level AOP magic:
1)Combined Pointcuts
 -Mastered logical operators (&&, ||, !) to create powerful expressions
 -Built modular, reusable advice triggers
2)Coded It Live

Day 39: Controlling the AOP Flow!
Today I learned how to orchestrate aspects like a conductor:
1) Aspect Ordering
 -Used @Order annotation to sequence advice
 -Prevented aspect execution chaos
2) Put It Into Practice
 -Ensured logging runs before security

Day 40: Intercepting Method Secrets with JoinPoints!
Today I unlocked AOP detective skills:
1) JoinPoint Insights
 -Intercepted method arguments in real-time
 -Accessed parameter values through JoinPoint API
2) Coded It Live
 -Logged argument values for debugging
 -Built dynamic advice based on runtime data
